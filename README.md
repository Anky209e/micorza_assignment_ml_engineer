# ML Engineer 1 Assignment â€“ Micorza

This repository contains my completed assignment for the ML Engineer 1 position at **Micorza**. The assignment involves building practical machine learning solutions across computer vision, NLP, and zero-shot classification using LLMs.

##  Contents

###  Bounding Box Grid Assignment (Computer Vision)
- Assigns bounding boxes to cells in an N x N grid based on their center coordinates.
- Returns a matrix indicating the number of bounding boxes per cell.

###  Sentiment Analysis System (NLP)
- **Baseline**: TF-IDF + SVM classifier
- **Advanced**: Fine-tuned `distilbert-base-uncased` transformer
- Includes performance comparison via accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

###  Zero-Shot Classification (LLM)
- Implements a zero-shot classification pipeline using `facebook/bart-large-mnli`.
- Supports arbitrary label sets with no prior training.

### (Optional) Question for Prompt Engineering
- Prompt for extracting required information from text block

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers
- Jupyter Notebooks
